The easiest way to do this if your systems supports it is to use the perl CPAN module:


Installation Without using the perl CPAN module
----------------------------------

First download the tar file
Make sure you have the latest version by going to

ftp://test.hackmare.com/pub/Current
ftp://roasp.com/pub/Current


UNIX, LINUX, BSD, OSX and WINDOWS with tar, a make program, and a c compiler
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

on the command line, type:

	tar -xvfz SVG-0.20.tar.gz
	
	perl Makefile.PL

	make 

	make test

	make install



WIN32 SYSTEMS WITHOUT nmake
---------------------------

win32 note: There is no ppm yet for this module. 
You need to either install it using nmake or you have to install to a local dirctory and explicitly call the module by using one of the following line in your calling program:

#using use lib
use lib 'path/where/the/release/is/located';

-or-

#using BEGIN block
BEGIN {
	push @INC 'path/to/svg.pm/file'; #where the SVG.pm file lives
	push @INC 'path/to/svg.pm/file/SVG'; # where the Utils.pm file lives
}


------------------------

KNOWN BUGS

Does not work under -w. There are two lines which complain. 
Will be addressed in the next release.

Does not support in-line generation of SVG for XML. It's mostly there but
there are still holes in the program.
